*Description*: The output of this Java-based File Management System reflects its core functionality and user-friendly interaction. When the program runs, it displays a simple menu with six options: creating a file, writing to a file, reading a file, deleting a file, listing files in a directory, and exiting the system. Let’s walk through the possible outputs for each option.
When the user selects the option to create a file, the program prompts them to enter a file path. If the file doesn’t already exist, the system creates it and displays:
"File created: [absolute file path]"
If the file already exists, the output changes to:
"File already exists."
For writing to a file, the user provides a file path and the content they want to write. If the operation succeeds, the output confirms:
"Data written to file."
If there’s an error, like an invalid path, the message reads:
"Error writing to file: [error message]"
When reading a file, the system asks for the file path and then prints the content of the file line by line. If the file doesn’t exist or an error occurs, it shows:
"Error reading file: [error message]"
The delete option produces clear feedback too. If the file is successfully removed, the output is:
"File deleted: [absolute file path]"
If the deletion fails, it shows:
"Failed to delete file."
For listing directory contents, the system checks if the directory exists and whether it’s valid. If everything is correct, it displays:
"Files in directory:" followed by the absolute paths of each file. If the directory is empty:
"The directory is empty."
If the directory path is incorrect:
"Error: The directory does not exist."
Or, if it’s not a directory:
"Error: The provided path is not a directory."
The system also handles user input errors gracefully. If an invalid menu option is entered, it outputs:
"Invalid choice! Please try again."
Finally, when the user selects the exit option, the output confirms:
"Exiting..."
In essence, the outputs of this program are designed to provide clear and informative messages for every possible scenario.
